SecDevOps Lab README
====================

This hands-on lab will demonstrate how to secure applications programmatically using a BIG-IP's iControl based REST API.

Leveraging programmability to deploy security policies and/or adhere to best practices during an applicationâ€™s lifecycle reduces the operational (e.g. time and money) cost of a defense in depth strategy.  Programmatic workflows can be developed and deployed for specific security use cases, and integrated into the SDLC process, allowing for the protection of an application to iterate in parallel with the development of the application.

This course will feature the following topics.

* General interaction with tmm via BIG-IPs REST APIs
* Create, modify and assign an AFM policy
* Create, modify and assign an ASM policy

Lab Guide
----------

This lab is divided into three parts.  Each section of the lab, will require configuration of the BIG-IP, AFM, or ASM using the iControl REST based API.  It is recomended that each lab be executed in order.

Support
-------

Bugs and enhancements can be made by opening an `issue`_ within the `GitHub`_ repository.
